            <p>My goal in this project was to apply my knowledge of JavaScript and Kaboom to create a shooting game.</p>

            <p>At first, I wasn’t sure what direction to take because I wanted my game to be unique. Then, I realized that I watch a lot of anime, so I thought, “Why not combine anime with my shooting game?” That’s how I decided to make my main character an anime-inspired figure.</p>

            <p>I faced several challenges throughout this year-long project. The first challenge occurred when my project partner left SEP in the middle of the year, requiring me to learn a new tool and create a game under time constraints. Another challenge was selecting the correct version of Kaboom. Whenever I added a version, it wouldn't work, so I had to research how to get the latest version on my IDE. Lastly, time management was a major hurdle—I had to learn my tool while also completing my MVP, which was difficult. I had to push myself to accomplish both.</p>

            <p>Despite these challenges, I gained valuable takeaways. First, I learned the importance of asking for help. Since I changed my tool mid-year, I sought guidance from friends who were familiar with Kaboom, which helped me grasp the tool faster. Second, I realized the value of exploring. Because I didn’t know where to start, I watched YouTube tutorials, which gave me a helpful head start with Kaboom. Lastly, time management proved crucial. Balancing learning my tool and finishing my project required organization, so I listed my tasks on paper to keep track of deadlines. These lessons are useful not only in projects but in everyday life.</p>
