            <h1 class="margin text-center">Sep11 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>My goal in this project was to use all of my knowledge of javascript and kaboom to creat a shooting game .</p>

           <p>At first, I didn't know what to do because I wanted my shooting game to be unique. Then, I realized that I watch a lot of anime, so I thought to myself, "Why not combine anime with my shooting game?" That’s when I decided to make the character in my game an anime character. And that’s how I came up with the idea for my game.</p>

<p>I faced many challenges during the process of creating my game because it was a year-long project. My first challenge came when my project partner left SEP in the middle of the year, forcing me to learn a new tool and create a game in a short amount of time. Another challenge was choosing the right version of Kaboom. Whenever I added a version of Kaboom, it wouldn’t work, so I had to research how to get the latest version of Kaboom on my IDE. My last challenge was time management—I had to learn my tool while also completing an MVP at the same time, which was really difficult. I had to work hard to achieve both.</p>

<p>Because I encountered many challenges, I also gained valuable takeaways. My first takeaway was learning to ask for help. Since I changed my tool in the middle of the year, I needed guidance, so I reached out to friends who were already familiar with Kaboom and asked them for assistance. That helped me learn the tool faster. My second takeaway was the importance of exploring. Since I didn’t know where to start, I watched YouTube videos to help me learn my tool more efficiently, which gave me a head start with Kaboom. My last takeaway was time management. I needed to balance learning my tool with finishing my Freedom Project, so I organized my tasks by writing down what I needed to do and when I needed to do it. That helped me stay on track and avoid mistakes. I believe these takeaways are useful not only for projects but for any aspect of life.</p>
